# Thick

Thick is very lightweight web server for JRuby based on excellent Netty library.

## Status

Works on several Sinatra and Rails applications. No real testing, yet.

## Speed

With no optimalizations, refactorings and no JVM tuning the server handles ~ 3000 req/s on my MacBook for simple Rack application.

## Installation

    gem install thick
